# projectimageonpointcloud
Small tool to project a 2D image onto a point cloud then either render or save the result. Uses OpenCV and PointCloudLibrary and incorporates CornerDetect by Geiger et al (2012) for image registration.

# CornerDetect
Realization of "Automatic Camera and Range Sensor Calibration using a single Shot" by C++;
This is a key work to detect checkerboard corners and plays a role in camera calibration.
